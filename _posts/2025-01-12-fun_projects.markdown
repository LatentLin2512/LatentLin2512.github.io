## 🧠 GPT-2 Project in ECE408
Here is the report of our **ParallelSlackers Team** project! 📄  
*(Actually, I combined the two reports into one.)*

I gained a lot from this project, including using strategies such as **Tensor Cores** and **reduction techniques** to optimize the GPT-2 model using **CUDA programming**.

## 🐧 Custom Linux Operating System in ECE391
**ThreadRipper** was the best team!  

We built a simple RISC-V operating system including key components like **virtual memory management** and a **filesystem with caching**. We also added **VirtIO devices**, such as `viogpu`, to support running fun games in our OS.  

Personally, I was responsible for the **ELF loader**, **system calls**, **process management**, and the **shell interface**. Additionally, I extended the shell by implementing **tab completion using a trie** and enabling **scrolling through command history** with the up and down keys, going beyond the course requirements.
