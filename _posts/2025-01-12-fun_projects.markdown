## 🧠 GPT-2 Project in ECE408
Here is the report of our **ParallelSlackers Team** project! 📄  
*(Actually, I combined the two reports into one.)*  

👉 [Read Our Project Report](https://latentlin2512.github.io/docs/ParallelSlackers_Report.pdf)

I learned a lot from this project. In particular, I worked on **CUDA-based optimization** of the GPT-2 model, applying techniques such as Tensor Cores, FlashAttention, and reduction strategies. I also used NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute to **profile** the execution and analyze performance bottlenecks.

## 🐧 Custom Linux Operating System in ECE391
**ThreadRipper** was the best team!  

We built a simple RISC-V operating system including key components like **virtual memory management** and a **filesystem with caching**. We also added **VirtIO devices**, such as `viogpu`, to support running fun games in our OS.  

Personally, I was responsible for the **ELF loader**, **system calls**, **process management**, and the **shell interface**. Additionally, I extended the shell by implementing **tab completion using a trie** and enabling **scrolling through command history** with the up and down keys, going beyond the course requirements.
